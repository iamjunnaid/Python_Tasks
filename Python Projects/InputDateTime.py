Implement the same exercise as Exercise 1 (Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old), except don\â€™t explicitly write out 
the year. Use the built-in Python datetime library to make the code you write work during every year, not just the one we are currently in.

'''
import datetime
name = input('Enter your name: ')
age = int(input('How old are you: '))
current_year = datetime.datetime.now()
print(f"{name} will be 100 years old at {current_year.year -age +100}")
