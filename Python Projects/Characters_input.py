'''
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to 
them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. Note: for this exercise, 
the expectation is that you explicitly write out the year (and therefore be out of date the next year).

name=input('What is your name?')
age=int(input('How old are you?'))
year=2024-age + 100

print(name +",you will be 100 years old at ",year)
